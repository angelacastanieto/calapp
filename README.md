## Assumptions
* Time slots will only be available from 8-6 local to userâ€™s current timezone
* Time slots will always be exactly 2 hours
* Assume can always derive timezone from client for now (I did include timezone in the user schema if we want to store that later - to handle things like users using the app in non-home timezones)

## Did not have time for
* Adding notes to bookings
* rating bookings
* deleting bookings
* deleting timeslots
